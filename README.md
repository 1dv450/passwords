# Passwords

This is a paper on the weaknesses of password-secured systems, and what we as developers can use
instead.

## Guidelines / Reviewing

**Subject to change**

Each section of the paper will be written in a branch. A pull request will be opened right away, and
merged when the entire section is finished.

This means that there will always be a pull request open where you can follow the progress, and make
comments. If your feedback is of general nature, make a normal comment on the pull request, if it is
referring to a specific piece of the text, you can create **line notes** by entering the `Files
changed` tab and clicking on the speech bubble that appears to the left of the line when hovering.

When commenting on a paragraph, put the line note on the **last** line in the paragraph, this is
because Github will show a snippet of the text _above_ the line when rendering the conversation.
